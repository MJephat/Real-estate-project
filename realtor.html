    <h3>Our committment</h3>
    <p> Work can be an escape. But when times are tough, working harder isn’t 
        always working smarter. Family and friends are important — they center us, and 
        they also count on us to be there. When work takes up all of your time, no one gets 
        the support they need.
        Ask yourself: Am I making the time for friends and family? Are the relationships 
        I have with those closest to me strong? Am I emotionally available even if I’m not 
        physically able to be there? Remember, friends and family are also referral resources.</p>
